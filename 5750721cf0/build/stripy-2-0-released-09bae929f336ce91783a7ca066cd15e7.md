We've been busy creating the next major release of [Stripy](https://github.com/underworldcode/stripy). To refresh your memory, Stripy is a Python tool for triangulating scattered points either in Cartesian coordinates or on the sphere. It wraps a bunch of Fortran codes in a neat, object-oriented Python interface that can be used for many geographical applications.

## What's new?

**Spline tension** - a lot of data transformations in Stripy are underpinned by cubic splines (e.g. interpolation, derivatives, smoothing). In v2.0 you can now add spline tension which avoids overshoot / undershoot artefacts. The most visible improvements are in accuracy of derivatives at points along the boundary and extrapolation of data beyond the boundary of a mesh.

**Voronoi diagram** - the Voronoi diagram is the dual of a Delaunay triangulation. For every triangle in the mesh, there is a voronoi point which lies at an equal radius from each node. The diagram is constructed by connecting up the voronoi points from each neighbouring triangle.

Other** notable new features** include:

- a new equispaced elliptical mesh in Cartesian coordinates

- central area node weights for any mesh

- efficient evaluation of second derivatives in Cartesian coordinates

- better documentation, LGPLv3 license, and other small bug fixes

You can install the latest release of Stripy with `pip`

```sh
pip install stripy
```

or Conda:

```sh
conda install -c underworldcode stripy
```

## Make Stripy better!
