A recent paper in the Journal of Open Source Software describes the implementation details of Underworld3 and a brief motivation for the rewritten codebase (Moresi et al, 2025).

Underworld3 combines the power of the symbolic algebra package, `sympy` (Meurer et al, 2017), with the equation templating system in the parallel finite-element framework of `PETSc`, through `petsc4py` (Knepley et al, 2013, Dalcin et al, 2011).

Underworld3 has the same capacity to mix Eulerian (mesh-based) variables with fully-Lagrangian (particle) variables in forming the complex expressions used to describe conservation equations and material properties.

The end result is a flexible, symbolic geodynamics package with a very low computational overhead and excellent parallel performance (here are the [parallel scaling results](/how-many-processors-should-we-use-to-solve-problem-x/)).

## GitHub releases and Zenodo archives

All Underworld releases are available through GitHub and are reflected in a [zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/records/16838572). There is a master doi for all Underworld3 releases to allow you to cite the software as a project: [10.5281/zenodo.16810746](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16810746). Individual releases have their own (unique) doi.

## Excerpt — the mathematical framework of Underworld 3

The symbolic layer of `underworld3` works with the "strong form" of a problem which is typically how the governing equations are derived and disseminated in publications and textbooks. The finite element method is based on a corresponding weak or variational form.

`PETSc` provides a template form for the automatic generation of weak forms [see Knepley et al, 2013]. We start from the strong-form of the problem which is defined through the functional $\mathcal{F}_s$ that expresses the balance between fluxes ($F(u, \nabla u)$), forces, $f(u, \nabla u)$, and unknowns $u$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:petsc-strong-form}  
\mathcal{F}_s(u) \sim \nabla \cdot F(u, \nabla u) - f(u, \nabla u) = 0  
\end{equation}

The discrete weak form and its Jacobian derivative would then be expressed through the related functional $\mathcal{F}_w$  as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:petsc-weak-form}  
\mathcal{F}_w(u) \sim \sum_e \epsilon_e^T \left[ B^T W f(u^q, \nabla u^q) + \sum_k D_k^T W F^k (u^q, \nabla u^q) \right] = 0  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:petsc-jacobian}  
\mathcal{F}_w'(u) \sim \sum_e \epsilon_e^T  
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}  
B^T  & D^T \\
\end{array} \right]  
W  
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}  
\partial {f}/{\partial {u}} &  
\partial {f}/{\partial \nabla {u}} \\
\partial {F}/{\partial {u}} &  
\partial {F}/{\partial \nabla {u}} \\
\end{array}\right]  
\left[  
\begin{array}{c}  
B^T  \\
D^T  
\end{array} \right]  
\epsilon _{e}  
\end{equation}

Here $\epsilon$ is the element restriction operator; $B$ is the matrix of basis function derivatives and $D$ is the constitutive matrix that, together, describe the relation between the unknowns and the flux. $q$ indicates that the values are determined at a set of quadrature points, and $W$ is a diagonal matrix of weights for these points.

The symbolic representation of the strong-form that is encoded in `underworld3` is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sympy-strong-form}  
\Bigl[ {D u}/{D t} \Bigr]  
-\nabla \cdot \Bigl[ \sigma(u, \nabla u, \mathbf{x}, t) \Bigr]  
-\Bigl[ \mathrm{H}(u, \nabla u, \mathbf{x},t) \Bigr]  
= 0  
\end{equation}

Here $\mathrm{H}$ represents sources and sinks of $u$, and ${D u}/{D t}$ is the material time derivative of $u$. The time derivatives of the unknowns are not present in the `PETSc` template but, after time-discretisation, they produce terms that are combinations of fluxes and flux history terms (which combine with $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ to contribute to $F$) and forces (which combine with $\mathbf{h}$ to contribute to $f$). The explicit time / position dependence in $\sigma$ is to highlight potential changes to boundary conditions or constitutive properties.

In `underworld3`, the user interacts with the time derivatives explicitly, and provides strong-form expressions for the template in {eq}`eq:sympy-strong-form`. `Sympy` automatically gathers all the flux-like terms and all the force-like terms into the form required by the `PETSc` template. All evaluations, derivatives and simplifications of functions in the `underworld3` symbolic layer are deferred until final assembly of the `PETSc` template and the compilation of the `C` functions.

The main benefits of combining `sympy` with the `PETSc` weak form template is a user environment that 1) provides symbolic, mathematical introspection, particularly in the context of Jupyter notebooks; 2) eliminates much of the `python` or `C` coding required for complex constitutive models; 3) eliminates any need for users to compute derivatives for the Newton solvers in `PETSc`.
